This is a Raspberry PI package that enables contains the base debian packages required to enable a routing between 2 interfacess and the basic network address translation so that the second interface is isolated inbound.  The internal interface also contains a DHCP service.  The DHCP server is using the open source project https://www.isc.org/dhcp/.  This was discontinued in 2022 as a project.  The Kea has replaced the ICS DHCP.  What was needed for simple implementation was expanded, and for tight simple code it is beyond the needful.
